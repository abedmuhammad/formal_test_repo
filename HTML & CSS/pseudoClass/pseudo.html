  <p>I have a log file that generates lines like these:

May 25 20:59:14 debian myprocess[1430]: pid 3490 started
May 25 20:59:14 debian myprocess[1415]: pid 3491 started
  </p>
  <div>
May 25 20:59:14 debian myprocess[1433]: pid 3492 started
May 25 20:59:15 debian myprocess[1433]: pid 3492 completed
May 25 20:59:17 debian myprocess[1451]: pid 3487 completed
May 25 20:59:17 debian myprocess[1451]: pid 3493 started
May 25 20:59:18 debian myprocess[1423]: pid 3489 completed
  </div>
<span>
How do I go about creating a shell script that tells the runtime of a pid i.e., subtracts its start time from its completed time( completed - started).

Example:

3490 started   --> 20:59:14
3490 completed --> 20:59:21
3491 started   --> 20:59:14
3491 completed --> 20:59:19

The script must evaluate all the pid and determine their elapsed time. It must return the average of the start to complete time for all pid.
</span>
Please suggest.

Thanks!
